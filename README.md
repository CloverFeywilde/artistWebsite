A minimalistic portfolio website made for illustrators and visual artist.
Comes with 2 masonry styled galleries, and a working contact form that requires serverside configuration.
Presently the website is prefilled with PentaKitty's info. But anyone is welcome to clear her info and use this as a template as needed.
